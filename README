# Deadname Remover Program For Twitter 

This is a program that scours your Twitter profile and deletes tweets that mention your
specified words or phrases, with the attempt to make a program that effectively and 
efficiently removes your deadname from your Twitter profile as much as possible.

Written in Python by a team at Trans*Code London on 31st March (and hopefully continued
on in the future, but, y'know, we're writing the README here), it uses Tweepy to 
interact with Twitter. 

Currently, this is the only way to get the program working, although we're working on
creating a website to interact with the program to make this easy and effective.

##Changes likely to be made

It needs a real cleanup. Like, a real good cleanup. The team initially was split across 
a couple of sides to the project, but ended up focusing in on this (tip: don't bother 
trying to work with the Facebook API unless you're doing marketing or you're King, and
don't even try to gather information from Google searches, they're not big fans).

It also needs a fair amount more work on making it pretty and effective.

Hosting it permanently in an efficient manner.

Ways around call limiter. 

Just loads more cleanup.
